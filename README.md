# The Chicken Lab


The Chicken Lab is a project dedicated to developing a web-based frontend platform for online food ordering, inspired by the renowned restaurant chain "El Pollo Loco." Our objective is to deliver a seamless user experience, allowing customers to effortlessly browse a menu and conveniently place their orders. The project emphasizes the creation of an intuitive frontend interface implemented using industry-standard technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is important to note that The Chicken Lab is an independent initiative and is not affiliated with the actual restaurant chain.
